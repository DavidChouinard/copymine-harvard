Parser for the Harvard Library Bibliographic Dataset

carlos@bueno.org

In late April 2012, Harvard University released 12 million records from their
library catalogs, including photos, journals, books, recordings, and manuscripts.
This data is in the public domain, but the format is wonky.
http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/bibdata

This is a parser for the "MARC21" data contained in the dump. It makes use of
Nathan Denny's MARC21 library, and adds a ton of stuff on top, including
friendly names for fields, and lots of heuristic tricks to determine the
content type of the items, which opens up even more metadata encoded in the
infamous "Record 008".

To use it, you need to download and unzip the Harvard set in the same directory.

Then run:

   python marc.py [sql|json] > your_file.txt

Also included are samples of the JSON and SQL output.

TODO:
  The SQL schema is terrible!
  More metadata parsing
  Better detection of music and audio
  Translate more fields
  alt_glyph support
